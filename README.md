# cli

A CLI library for Go using generics.

There are a few really nice CLI libraries for Go like spf13/cobra, urfave/cli,
alecthomas/kingpin, etc. Even the builtin flag library isn't too bad. I've
created a lot of CLI tools over the years in Go and while Cobra came the
closest, something about it always felt wrong. So this library is my standard on
how constructing a CLI should look.

## Usage
