# cli

A better package for building command line apps in Go with minimal dependencies.

Well, better is objective but I think it's pretty great.

## Usage

You can structure your app however you want, but typically it looks like this:

```
{app-name}
├── app
│   └── create.go
└── main.go
```

See the [examples](examples) for more.
